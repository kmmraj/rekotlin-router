/**
This is ReKotlin's built in action type, it is the only built in type that conforms to the
`Action` protocol. `StandardAction` can be serialized and can therefore be used with developer
tools that restore state between app launches.


It is recommended that you define your own types that conform to `Action` - if you want to be able
to serialize your custom action types, you can implement `StandardActionConvertible` which will
make it possible to generate a `StandardAction` from your typed action - the best of both worlds!

    Within this initializer you need to use the payload from the `StandardAction` to configure the
    state of your custom action type.

    Example:

    ```
    init(_ standardAction: StandardAction) {
    this.twitterUser = standardAction.payload!["twitterUser"]!!
    }

    - Note: If you, as most developers, only use action serialization/deserialization during
    development, you can feel free to use the unsafe `!` operator.

    Use the information from your custom action to generate a `StandardAction`. The `type` of the

    configure the payload of the `StandardAction`.
